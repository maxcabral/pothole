App for submitting potholes and other road issues to the city of Los Angekes

This was my team's winning submission for the 2012 AT&T Social Good Hackathon at LA City College.

If you're looking for a way to submit potholes to the City of LA, as coincidence would have it, shortly after we won the hackathon the LADWP released an updated app with this feature, and the City of LA itself released a dedicated 511 app. You're likely better off using one of those two apps.
